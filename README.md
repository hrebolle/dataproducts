# Cousera Developing Data Products 
## Final Project

This repository contains the code, data and documentation files for the shiny application developed as final project for this course.

The application allows the user to browse over a set of records of earthquakes occurred from 1900 to 2015, in a rectangular zone of coordinates (North: -13, South: -52, East: -60, West: -77), which corresponds to the subduction zone of the Nazca plate. The data set was obtained from the USGS Earthquake Archives site.

The files contained in this repository are:

1. ui.R: User Interface file, controls the appearance of the application
2. server.R: Server-side file, provides the response to the actions requested by the user on the user interface.
3. global.R: data and variables required by both, ui.R and server.R
4. NazcaQuakes.csv: actual data downloaded from the USGS Earthquake Archives site.
5. index.Rmd: source for the slidify presentation of this application.
6. README.md: This file.
7. 

The application is available in [shinyapps.io] (https://hrebolle.shinyapps.io/Quakes).

The presentation of the application can be seen in:
